    "- Stored in a file (e.g., `.exe` in Windows), executed when run.  \n",

    "## 2. Process\n",
    "- A **process** = an instance of a program in execution.  \n",
    "- **Example**: Double-clicking Chrome → opens one process (another tab = another process).  \n",
    "- Each process has its own **memory space**: code, data, heap, stack, registers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points**:\n",
    "- Processes are independent.  \n",
    "- One process **cannot corrupt** another (separate memory).  \n",

    "**Types**:\n",
    "- **Single-threaded process** → only one thread.  \n",
    "- **Multi-threaded process** → multiple threads inside same process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points**:\n",
    "- Lighter than processes.  \n",
    "- Faster to create/switch.  \n",
    "- Threads inside a process are **dependent** (if process crashes → all threads die).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**:\n",
    "- In **MS Paint** → drawing rectangle = one thread, drawing circle = another thread.  \n",
