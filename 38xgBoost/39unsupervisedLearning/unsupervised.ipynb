    "\n",
    "When we say **supervised machine learning algorithm**, it means the dataset given to us has:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some **features**: \\( f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4 \\)  \n",
    "- One **dependent (output) feature** \\( y \\)  \n",

    "The problem statements in supervised learning are typically of two types:\n",

    "\n",
    "In **unsupervised machine learning**, the goal is to **group data into clusters** (Clustering).  \n",

    "- The dataset contains features (e.g., age, years of experience, salary)  \n",

    "**Goal:** Group people with **similar age, experience, and salary** into clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cluster 1 → People with similar age, experience, and salary  \n",

    "1. Suppose we own a product and have a list of customers with:\n",

    "   - Salary  \n",
    "   - Spending score  \n",

    "2. By applying **unsupervised ML**, we can segment customers:\n",

    "   - Group A → People who buy products immediately  \n",
    "   - Group B → People who buy occasionally  \n",
