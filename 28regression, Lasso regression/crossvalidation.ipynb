    "# Cross-Validation in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation is a technique used to **assess the performance of a machine learning model** and to **tune hyperparameters** effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Splitting Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training Data**: Used to train the model.\n",
    "2. **Validation Data**: Used to **tune hyperparameters**.\n",
    "3. **Test Data**: Used to **evaluate final model performance** on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Split\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have 1000 records:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Train-Test Split:** 70% train, 30% test\n",
    "* **Train-Validation Split:** Further divide training data for hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Cross-Validation?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Single train-validation split depends on **random state**.\n",
    "* Different splits yield different accuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Accuracy} \\in [75%, 92%]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cross-validation provides a **robust estimate** of model performance by averaging results across multiple splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Types of Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each experiment uses **one record as validation** and the rest as training.\n",
    "* For (n) records, perform (n) experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Training size: 500\n",
    "* Experiment 1: Record 1 → validation, Records 2-500 → training\n",
    "* Experiment 2: Record 2 → validation, Records 1 & 3-500 → training\n",
    "* ... up to Experiment 500\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computationally expensive for large datasets\n",
    "* High chance of **overfitting** due to very small validation set\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Leave-P-Out Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Similar to LOOCV but uses **p records** as validation.\n",
    "* Hyperparameter (p) can be tuned (e.g., 10, 20, 30).\n",
    "* Reduces number of experiments compared to LOOCV.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. K-Fold Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Divide training data into (k) folds of equal size.\n",
    "* Perform (k) experiments, each fold used once as validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formulas:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Fold size} = \\frac{n}{k}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: (n = 500, k = 5) → Fold size = 100\n",
    "* Experiment 1: Fold 1 → validation, Folds 2-5 → training\n",
    "* Experiment 2: Fold 2 → validation, Folds 1, 3-5 → training\n",
    "* ...\n",
    "* Average the accuracies:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{CV Accuracy} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\text{Accuracy}_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ensures **class proportions** in each fold are similar to the original dataset.\n",
    "* Particularly useful for **imbalanced classification**.\n",
    "* Prevents a validation fold from having only one class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Binary classification: 60 ones, 40 zeros\n",
    "* Each fold maintains ~60% ones, 40% zeros\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Time Series Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "* For **time-dependent data**, order matters.\n",
    "* Split sequentially based on time:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Training: Day 1 → Day t}, \\quad \\text{Validation: Day t+1 → Day t+n}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Random splitting is **not allowed**.\n",
    "* Useful for applications like **sentiment analysis over time** or **stock price prediction**.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Cross-validation helps **robust hyperparameter tuning**.\n",
