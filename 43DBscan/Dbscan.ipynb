    "- <span style=\"color:blue;\">K-Means Clustering</span>  \n",
    "- <span style=\"color:green;\">Hierarchical Clustering</span>  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Let’s consider this 2D dataset (diagram source: **Wikipedia** 🧾).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this diagram, you’ll typically find **three types of points**:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **<span style=\"color:orange;\">Epsilon (ε)</span>** → The **radius** of the neighborhood around a point.  \n",
    "2. **<span style=\"color:green;\">MinPts</span>** → The **minimum number of points** required within ε to form a dense region.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, DBSCAN classifies points as **core**, **border**, or **outlier** based on these two parameters.\n",
    "\n",

    "A point is a **Border Point** if:\n",
    "- It **lies within ε** of a **Core Point**,  \n",
    "- But **itself does not have enough neighbors** (i.e., fewer than MinPts) within its ε-radius.\n",

    "\n",
    "A point is an **Outlier** (or **Noise**) if it is **neither a core point nor a border point**.\n",

    "Now:\n",
    "1. If you draw a circle of radius \\( \\varepsilon \\) around a point and find **4 or more neighbors**, it becomes a **Core Point (🔴)**.  \n",
    "2. If there are **less than 4**, but the point is **close to a core point**, it’s a **Border Point (🟡)**.  \n",

    "3. - If the number of neighbors ≥ MinPts → mark as **Core Point** and form a new cluster.  \n",
    "   - If < MinPts → temporarily mark as **Noise**.  \n",
    "4. **Expand the cluster** by recursively including all **density-reachable points** (neighbors of core points).  \n",
