    "### 🟢 1. No Need to Specify Number of Clusters\n",
    "Unlike **K-Means**, DBSCAN does **not** require you to specify the number of clusters beforehand.  \n",
    "It automatically detects clusters based on **density** using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:orange\">Core Points</span>  \n",
    "- <span style=\"color:blue\">Border Points</span>  \n",
    "- <span style=\"color:red\">Outliers (Noise)</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the clustering process becomes **data-driven** and **unsupervised**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🟣 2. Finds Arbitrary-Shaped Clusters\n",
    "DBSCAN can detect **clusters of any shape**, including **non-linear** or **nested clusters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider two clusters where one is entirely surrounded by another:\n",

    "- **Euclidean Distance**:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "d(p, q) = \\sqrt{(p_x - q_x)^2 + (p_y - q_y)^2}\n",

    "### 🔴 3. Struggles with Varying Densities\n",
    "If clusters in your dataset have different densities, DBSCAN may fail to detect them properly.  \n",

    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- Dense cluster → ✅ Detected easily  \n",
    "- Sparse cluster → ⚠️ May be split or treated as noise  \n",
    "\n",
    "This happens because $$\\varepsilon$$ (radius) is **fixed globally** and cannot adapt to different density regions.\n",

    "### 🔴 4. Difficult to Choose $$\\varepsilon$$\n",
    "Selecting an appropriate epsilon ($$\\varepsilon$$) value can be challenging, especially when feature scales differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $$\\varepsilon$$ is **too small** ⇒ Many noise points  \n",
    "- If $$\\varepsilon$$ is **too large** ⇒ Merged clusters  \n",
