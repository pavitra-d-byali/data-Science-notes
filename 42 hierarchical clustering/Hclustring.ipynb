    "### 📐 Example\n",

    "- Merge <span style=\"color:orange;\">P4 & P5</span> → small height  \n",
    "- Merge <span style=\"color:blue;\">P1 & P2</span> → slightly larger height  \n",
    "- Merge <span style=\"color:red;\">P6</span> with (P4,P5) → higher height  \n",
    "- Merge <span style=\"color:green;\">P3</span> with (P1,P2) → even higher  \n",

    "## ✳️ Understanding Distance (Height)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **height** of each merge in the dendrogram corresponds to the **Euclidean Distance** at which clusters were joined.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use either of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D(P_i, P_j) = \\sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2}\n",

    "\n",
    "We select a **threshold distance** on the y-axis and draw a **horizontal line**.  \n",
    "Where this line cuts the dendrogram defines the **number of clusters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- If threshold = 4 → line cuts **2 vertical bars** → **k = 2**\n",
    "- If threshold = 2.5 → line cuts **4 vertical bars** → **k = 4**\n",
