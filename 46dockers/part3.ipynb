    "### 🔹 Method 1 — Rebuild with the Correct Name\n",
    "\n",
    "First, remove the existing image:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker image rm -f welcome_app\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker images\n",
    "```\n",

    "You’ll now see:\n",

    "krishna06/welcome_app   latest    123abc456def   1.8GB\n",
    "```\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "docker tag welcome_app krishna06/welcome_app1\n",
