    "# 🌳 Decision Tree Regressor\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we’ll discuss the **Decision Tree Regressor**, which is the regression counterpart of the Decision Tree Classifier.\n",
    "Previously, we explored how Decision Trees solve **classification problems** using **entropy**, **Gini impurity**, and **information gain**.\n",
    "Now, we’ll see how Decision Trees can also handle **regression problems**, where the **target variable is continuous**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📈 What is a Regression Problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a regression problem, the **output feature** is **continuous** — for example, predicting **salary**, **house price**, or **temperature**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, whenever our target (output) feature is a continuous value, we use a **Decision Tree Regressor** instead of a classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Example Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s consider a simple dataset with two features:\n",

    "| Experience | Career Gap | Salary (Target) |\n",
    "| ---------- | ---------- | --------------- |\n",
    "| 1          | 0          | 40K             |\n",

    "## 🌿 How the Splitting Works\n",
    "\n",
    "In Decision Tree Classifier, we used measures such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Entropy**\n",
    "* **Gini Impurity**\n",
    "* **Information Gain**\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in Decision Tree Regressor, our output is **continuous**, so these measures are **not applicable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we use **Variance Reduction** (or equivalently, **Mean Squared Error Reduction**) to determine the **best split**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧮 Step 1: Variance Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The **variance** for a node is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Var = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ( y_i ) = individual sample output\n",
    "* ( \\bar{y} ) = mean (average) of all outputs in that node\n",
    "* ( n ) = number of samples in the node\n",
    "\n",
    "This is equivalent to the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 Step 2: Compute Variance for the Root Node\n",
    "\n",
    "For our dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = [40, 42, 52, 60, 56]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean of the root node:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{y} = 50\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now compute variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Var_{root} = \\frac{1}{5}[(40-50)^2 + (42-50)^2 + (52-50)^2 + (60-50)^2 + (56-50)^2]\n",
    "$$\n",

    "1. Split at **≤ 2**\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧮 Step 4: Variance Reduction Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Variance Reduction (VR)** is computed as:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "VR = Var_{root} - \\sum_i w_i Var_i\n",

    "* Left node: ( w_L = \\frac{2}{5} )\n",
    "* Right node: ( w_R = \\frac{3}{5} )\n",

    "\n",
    "Once the Decision Tree is trained, for a **new data point**, we traverse the tree and reach a **leaf node**.\n",
    "\n",
    "At that leaf node:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The predicted value is the **average of all target values** in that node.\n",
