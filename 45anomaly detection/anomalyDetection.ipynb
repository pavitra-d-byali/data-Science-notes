    "# 🧠 Unsupervised Machine Learning – Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Introduction\n",
    " \n",
    "We’re going to continue our discussion on **Unsupervised Machine Learning**, focusing today on **<span style=\"color:orange\">Anomaly Detection</span>**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we talk about anomaly detection, it basically means detecting **<span style=\"color:red\">outliers</span>** — data points that deviate significantly from the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Real-World Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bank Account Security**  \n",
    "   Imagine your bank account is in India.  \n",
    "   If someone tries to log in using your credentials from another country, your bank immediately sends a security alert.  \n",
    "   How is this detected?  \n",
    "   → By identifying this login as an **<span style=\"color:red\">anomaly</span>**, since it’s an unusual event.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cancer Detection**  \n",
    "   Only a small subset of patients have cancer.  \n",
    "   Those rare cases act as **outliers**.  \n",
    "   Detecting these anomalies helps save lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cybersecurity (Fake IPs)**  \n",
    "   If a hacker uses a suspicious IP to access a server, anomaly detection can flag it as an outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cricket Example (IPL)**  \n",
    "   Suppose in IPL, the runs per over are:  \n",
    "   15, 10, 12, **100**.  \n",
    "   Clearly, scoring **100 runs in one over** is impossible.  \n",
    "   Hence, it’s an **outlier** — an anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌲 Isolation Forest (Concept)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **<span style=\"color:orange\">Isolation Forest</span>** is an **unsupervised anomaly detection technique** based on **decision trees**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though it uses trees internally, it **does not require labeled data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 Basic Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two features:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_1, f_2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, plot your data points — most will form **clusters**, but a few will be far away.  \n",
    "Those isolated points are **potential anomalies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Isolation Forest works by **isolating** these data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It builds multiple **Isolation Trees**.  \n",
    "- Each tree **randomly splits features** until every data point becomes a **leaf node**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a data point is **isolated in fewer splits**, it’s more likely an **outlier**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 Example Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s imagine a 2D feature space:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clustered region → Normal points  \n",
    "- A few distant points → Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm splits the data like a decision tree:\n",
    "- Some splits isolate normal points deeper in the tree.  \n",
    "- Outliers are isolated **quickly**, in **fewer paths (shallow depth)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence:\n",
    "- **Fewer splits → Higher anomaly likelihood**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧮 Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the **anomaly score**, we use:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "s(x, m) = 2^{-\\frac{E[h(x)]}{c(m)}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "| Symbol | Meaning |\n",
    "|:--|:--|\n",
    "| $$x$$ | Data point for which we calculate anomaly score |\n",
    "| $$m$$ | Sample size (number of data points) |\n",
    "| $$h(x)$$ | Path length (depth to isolate $$x$$ in an isolation tree) |\n",
    "| $$E[h(x)]$$ | Average path length for $$x$$ across all trees |\n",
    "| $$c(m)$$ | Average path length of unsuccessful searches in a Binary Search Tree of size $$m$$ |\n",
