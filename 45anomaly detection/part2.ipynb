    "# 🧠 DBSCAN for Anomaly Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello guys 👋  \n",
    "\n",
    "So we are going to continue the discussion with respect to **Anomaly Detection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this video, we will understand how we can perform **Anomaly Detection using DBSCAN Clustering**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 Quick Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already discussed the **theoretical concept** of DBSCAN — how clustering actually happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important feature of DBSCAN is that it can create **clusters in a non-linearly separable dataset**, which is its biggest advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because DBSCAN can handle **non-linear structures**, it also helps in detecting **outliers**, which is useful for **anomaly detection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN categorizes data points into three types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:#e63946;\">Core Point</span>  \n",
    "- <span style=\"color:#ff9f1c;\">Border Point</span>  \n",
    "- <span style=\"color:#2ec4b6;\">Noise / Outlier</span>  \n",
    "\n",
    "For anomaly detection, the **Noise or Outliers** play a crucial role, as they represent **abnormal data points**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 How DBSCAN Works\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN uses two hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Epsilon (ε)** → Radius of neighborhood  \n",
    "2. **MinPts** → Minimum number of points required to form a dense region\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔴 Core Point\n",
    "\n",
    "A point is a <span style=\"color:#e63946;\">core point</span> if:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Number of points within radius (ε)} \\geq \\text{MinPts}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "If `MinPts = 4` and a point has 6 neighbors within ε,  \n",
    "then it is a **core point**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🟡 Border Point\n",
    "\n",
    "A point is a <span style=\"color:#ff9f1c;\">border point</span> if:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Number of points within radius (ε)} < \\text{MinPts}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "If `MinPts = 4` and a point has only 3 neighbors,  \n",
    "then it is a **border point**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔵 Outlier (Noise Point)\n",
    "\n",
    "A point is considered an <span style=\"color:#2ec4b6;\">outlier</span> (or **noise point**) if:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{No other points exist within radius (ε)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the **abnormal points** — our **anomalies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "In DBSCAN clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Red points** → Core points  \n",
    "- **Yellow points** → Border points  \n",
    "- **Blue points** → Noise / Outliers  \n",
    "\n",
    "In anomaly detection, our **focus is on the outliers**, as they represent the data points that deviate significantly from normal patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "Let’s look at a practical example in Python 👇\n",

    "Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "eps = 0.10 → defines the neighborhood radius\n",
    "\n",

    "Points with label = -1 are outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "In the output plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see clusters (colored groups)\n",

    "DBSCAN can detect non-linear clusters effectively\n",
