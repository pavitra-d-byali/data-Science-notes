    "# 🔍 Local Outlier Factor (LOF) for Anomaly Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello guys 👋  \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we are going to continue our discussion on **Anomaly Detection**.  \n",
    "In this video, we’ll see how we can perform **anomaly detection** or **find important outliers** using **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into LOF, let’s define two important terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **<span style=\"color:#ff595e;\">Local Outlier</span>**\n",
    "- **<span style=\"color:#ffca3a;\">Global Outlier</span>**\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to clearly understand the difference between these two.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔴 Global Outlier\n",
    "\n",
    "A **global outlier** is a point that lies **completely far away** from all the clusters.  \n",
    "It is **globally different** from the rest of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "If a single point lies far outside all other groups, it is a **global outlier**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🟠 Local Outlier\n",
    "\n",
    "A **local outlier** lies **close to a cluster** but doesn’t fit perfectly within it.  \n",
    "It is “locally” inconsistent compared to its nearby data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "Points near a cluster boundary but not exactly following its density.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Why Use Local Outlier Factor?\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous videos, we used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DBSCAN Clustering** 🌀  \n",
    "- **Isolation Forest** 🌲  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both can detect outliers effectively.  \n",
    "However, to specifically detect **local outliers**, we use **LOF** — which focuses on **local density**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Understanding the Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "**Local Outlier Factor (LOF)** is based on the idea of **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It measures how isolated a data point is compared to its neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📘 Key Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given data point \\( x \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find its **k nearest neighbors**.  \n",
    "2. Compute the **local density** around \\( x \\).  \n",
    "3. Compare the density of \\( x \\) with the densities of its neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "If \\( x \\)’s density is **much lower** than that of its neighbors,  \n",
    "then \\( x \\) is likely a **local outlier**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚗️ Mathematical Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say \\( k = 5 \\).  \n",
    "We take 5 nearest neighbors for each point.\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculate the **average distance** from the point to its \\( k \\)-neighbors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{AvgDist}(x) = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} d(x, x_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- If **distance is small**, the **local density** is **high**.  \n",
    "- If **distance is large**, the **local density** is **low**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we compare densities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{LOF}(x) = \\frac{\\text{Average local density of neighbors}}{\\text{Local density of point } x}\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{LOF}(x) > 1\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "then \\( x \\) is an **outlier**.  \n",
    "The **higher** the value, the **stronger** the outlier.\n",
